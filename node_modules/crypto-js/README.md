# crypto-js

JavaScript library of crypto standards.

## Discontinued

Active development of CryptoJS has been discontinued. This library is no longer maintained.

Nowadays, NodeJS and modern browsers have a native `Crypto` module. The latest version of CryptoJS already uses the native Crypto module for random number generation, since `Math.random()` is not crypto-safe. Further development of CryptoJS would result in it only being a wrapper of native Crypto. Therefore, development and maintenance has been discontinued, it is time to go for the native `crypto` module.

## Node.js (Install)

Requirements:

- Node.js
- npm (Node.js package manager)

```bash
npm install crypto-js
```

### Usage

ES6 import for typical API call signing use case:

```javascript
import sha256 from 'crypto-js/sha256';
import hmacSHA512 from 'crypto-js/hmac-sha512';
import Base64 from 'crypto-js/enc-base64';

const message, nonce, path, privateKey; // ...
const hashDigest = sha256(nonce + message);
const hmacDigest = Base64.stringify(hmacSHA512(path + hashDigest, privateKey));
```

Modular include:

```javascript
var AES = require("crypto-js/aes");
var SHA256 = require("crypto-js/sha256");
...
console.log(SHA256("Message"));
```
